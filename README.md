# BST-Design-Patterns
Implementation of a simple binary search tree with explicit use of design patterns.

Nodes of the tree contain strings. Functionality includes node addition and iterator-based traversal. Ordering behavior is encapsulated in a Strategy object. Null objects act as tree leaves. Demonstration of the Decorator pattern is (trivially) applied to the iterator to apply additional behaviors.

TestBST.java contains unit tests.
